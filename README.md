# nn.hpp : Basic neural network library (header-only)

This basic neural network library was written for personal use and learning purpose only. It is still under development and I will randomly add more features over time.  

The `./examples` folder contains a few examples of use-cases, such as handwritten digits recognition using the MNIST dataset. 

## Usage

The library is header-only, and all you have to do to use it is to include `nn.hpp` in your code.

## TODO ideas

* Add some sort of interesting visualization or GUI (fun but not very useful, as this library is not fast enough for production anyways.)
* Add more layers 
* Make things faster (matrix products, forward passes, etc)
