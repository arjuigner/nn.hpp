# nn.hpp : Basic neural network library

This basic neural network library was written for personal use and learning purpose only. It is still under development and I will randomly add more features over time.  

The ./examples folder contains a few examples of use-cases, such as handwritten digits recognition using the MNIST dataset. 

## TODO ideas

* Add some sort of interesting visualization or GUI (fun but not very useful, as this library is not fast enough for production anyways.)
* Add more layers 
* Make things faster (matrix products, forward passes, etc)
